# Gerrit

SmartGit provides a **Push to Gerrit** command in the **Branches** view
if a Gerrit remote has been detected. It will offer a dialog with
special Gerrit-related Push options.

SmartGit will detect a remote as being connected to Gerrit, if:

-   `.git/hooks/commit-msg` exists; and
-   an appropriate `remote` can be determined from `.gitconfig` for the
    selected branch:  
    -   if the remote is configured as `review.remote` this remote will
        be used; you should already have the appropriate configuration
        present when you are using the [git-review command line
        tool](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/Tutorial).
    -   if the branch is tracking a remote branch and its remote is
        connecting to port 29418 (default Gerrit SSH port), this remote
        will be used
    -   if the branch is not tracking a remote branch:
        -   if there is a unique remote connecting to port 29418, this
            remote is used
        -   if there is no remote connecting to port 29418 but there is
            just a single remote overall, this remote is used



To have Gerrit-related commands available in context menu,
set [Low-level Property](System-Properties.md) `ui.showPushToGerritInMenu`.





If **Push to Gerrit** doesn't show up for you despite of the above
conditions being met, you may enable debug logging for
"smartgit.gerrit". For details refer to Debugging.
