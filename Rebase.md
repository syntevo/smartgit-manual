# Rebase

The Rebase command allows you to apply commits from one branch to
another. Rebase can be viewed as more powerful version of
[Cherry-Pick](#Rebase-cherry-pick), which is optimized to apply multiple
commits from one branch to another. In SmartGit, a distinction is made
between **Rebase HEAD to** and **Rebase to HEAD**:

**Rebase HEAD to** rebases ("moves") the commits below the HEAD to the
selected commit. The HEAD will be moved to the new fork.



``` text
o  [> master] A               o  [> master] A'
|                             |
o   B                         o  B'
|                             |
o   C                         o  C'
|                             |
|   o  [a-branch] D           |   o  [a-branch] D
|   |                         |  /
|   |                         | /
|   o  E (selected)   ===>    o   E
|  /                          |
| /                           |
o   F                         o   F
```



**Rebase to HEAD** duplicates commits from a separate branch to the HEAD
(similar to what [Cherry-Pick](#Rebase-cherry-pick) does). The HEAD
moves forward on its fork.



``` text
                             o  [> master] B'
                             |
                             o  C'
                             |
                             o  D'
                             |
o  [> master] A              o  A
|                            |
|   o  [a-branch]            |   o  [a-branch]
|   |                        |   |
|   o  B (selected)          |   o  B
|   |                        |   |
|   o  C               ==>   |   o  C
|   |                        |   |
|   o  D                     |   o  D
|  /                         |  /
| /                          | /
o   E                        o   E
```



To **Rebase Onto** you may use the **Log** window. Consider following
example where the `quickfix2` branch should not start at the `quickfix1`
branch, but rather on the `master` branch:



``` text
q2b (quickfix2)
 |
q2a
 |
q1b (quickfix1)
 |
q1a
 |
 x (master)
 |
...
```



To achieve this, just drag the `q2a` commit onto the `x (master)` commit
and you will get the desired result:



``` text
q2b (quickfix2)
 |
q2a
 |
 |  q1b (quickfix1)
 |   |
 |  q1b
 | /
 x (master)
 |
...
```



In SmartGit, there are several places from which you can initiate a
rebase:

-   **Menu and toolbar** On the main window, select **Branch\|Rebase
    HEAD to** or **Branch\|Rebase to HEAD** to open the **Rebase**
    dialog, where you can select the branch to rebase the HEAD onto, or
    the branch to rebase onto the HEAD, respectively. Depending on your
    toolbar settings, you can also open this dialog via the buttons
    **Rebase HEAD to** and **Rebase to HEAD** on the toolbar.
-   **Branches view** In the **Branches** view, you can right-click on a
    branch and select **Rebase HEAD to** to rebase your current HEAD
    onto the selected branch.
-   **Log Graph** On the Log graph of the **Log** window, you can
    perform a rebase by right-clicking on a commit and selecting
    **Rebase HEAD to** or **Rebase to HEAD** from the context-menu.
-   **Log Graph** In the Log graph of the **Log** window, you can drag
    and drop commits or refs and then select to rebase in the occurring
    dialog after the drop.

Just like a merge, a rebase may fail due to merge conflicts. If that
happens, SmartGit will leave the working tree in *rebasing* state,
allowing you to either manually resolve the conflicts or to **Abort**
the rebase. See [Resolving Conflicts](#Rebase-resolve-conflicts) for
further information.

## Interactive Rebase

You can start an interactive Rebase in the Journal view by
right-clicking the first commit that should be changed. For further
information, please see [Journal View](Journal-View.md).

## Resolving Conflicts

Core Git rebase conflicts are different to other kinds of merge
conflicts, because *left* and *right* files are swapped: when rebasing
branch `A` to `B`, Git will first checkout `B`, then applies all commits
from `A`. If a conflict occurs, `HEAD` still points to `B` and hence the
*left* file would be the file as it's present in `B`.

From a user's perspective, the *left* file should always be his/her own
file ("ours"), i.e. the file as it's present in `A`. For this reason, in
case of rebase conflicts, SmartGit will swap *left* and *right* files.
This gives a more consistent user experience, however may result in
following different behavior (compared to normal merge conflicts):

-   When staging left lines (**Ours**) in the **Conflict Solver**, these
    lines will finally show up as staged, because your rebase branch `B`
    is actually "theirs"
-   When invoking **Resolve** and selecting **Ours**, you will see
    staged file content, because your rebase branch `B` is actually
    "theirs"
