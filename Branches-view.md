# Branches view

The **Branches** view shows *local* and *remote* branches, tags and
other *refs* from your repository and offers operations on these
*refs*. *Remotes* will also be displayed and used to group the *remote
branches*.

## Tag-Grouping

The **Tags**-part of the **Branches** view will be grouped according to
a *tag-grouping configuration*. This configuration is stored in your
repository's `.git/config` and can be edited in the Log using
**View\|Tag-Grouping**. To disable this grouping feature for the current
repository, set both **Pattern** fields empty.
