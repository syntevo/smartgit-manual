# GitHub integration

SmartGit integrates GitHub workflows in various places, provided that
the connection to *github.com* or a custom *GitHub Enterprise instance*
has been configured in the Preferences.

### Setup

To set up the GitHub integration, go to **Preferences**, section
**Hosting Providers** and use **Add** there. In the **Add Hosting
Provider** dialog, have **GitHub** selected and invoke **Generate API
token**. This should open up your default web browser where you will
have to confirm by **Authorize Application**. Be sure to also **Grant
Access** to all of your organizations, otherwise the corresponding
organization repositories won't show up/can't be accessed.

Once you have confirmed this page, you will be redirected to
*syntevo.com*, where the generated access code will be displayed.
Copy&paste this code into SmartGit's **Generate API Token** dialog and
invoke **Authenticate**. The code will be used to create an *application
access token* which will be used to populate the **Token** field.
Finally, confirm the **Add Hosting Provider** dialog using **Add**.

#### Info

## Clone

When
[cloning](Repository-Related.md#Repository-Related-clone) a
repository, you can select your repository from a list, instead of
entering the URL. SmartGit will display your own (*user*) repositories,
as well as repositories of your *organization* (*org*).

## Main Window

The main window contains a light-weight GitHub integration which just
indicates incoming pull requests in the title of the **Branches** view.



Detailed pull request information and operations on pull requests are
only available in the **Log** (see below).



## Log

In the *Log* window of your repository, you can interact with GitHub in
following ways.

### Pull Requests

When initially loading the Log, SmartGit will also refresh information
on related *Pull Requests* from the GitHub server:

-   **Incoming** pull requests are those which other users are
    requesting to pull from their repositories. They are displayed in a
    separate category called **Pull Requests** in the **Branches** view.
-   **Outgoing** pull requests are those which you have sent to other
    users/repositories, requesting them to pull your changes. They are
    display directly below the local (or if it does not exist), the
    remote branch in the **Branches** view.

*Incoming* pull requests, in first place, are just known on the server.
To get the commits, which such a pull request includes, locally, use
invoke **Fetch Pull Request** from the context menu of the pull request.
This will fetch all commits from the foreign repository to a special
branch in your local repository and will create an additional *merge*
node between the *base* commit from which the pull request has been
forked and the latest (foreign) pull request commit. When selecting this
*merge* node in the **Commits** view, you can see the entire changes
which a multi-commit pull request includes and you can
[comment](#comments) on these changes, if necessary. After commenting
changes, it's probably a good idea to **Reject** the pull request to
signal the initiator of the pull request, that modifications are
required before you are willing to pull his changes. If you are fine
with a pull request, you may **Merge** it. This will request the GitHub
server to merge the pull request and then SmartGit will pull the
corresponding branch, so you will have the merged changes locally
available.

*Outgoing* pull requests can be **Fetch**ed as well, however this is
usually not necessary, as the pull request belongs to you and it
contains your own commits. If you decide that you want to take a pull
request back, use **Reject**.

For a pull request which had been fetched once, there was a special
*ref* created which will make it show up in the **Pull Requests**
category, even if it is not present on the server anymore. In this case,
you may use **Drop Local Data** on such a pull request to get rid of the
corresponding ref, the local merge commit, all other commits of the pull
request and the entry in **Pull Requests** as well. It's safe to use
**Drop Local Data**, as it will only affect the local repository and you
can re-fetch a pull request anytime you like using **Fetch** again.

You can invoke **Review\|Sync** to manually update the displayed
information. Usually you will want to do that, if you know that
server-side information has changed since the Log has been opened.

To create a pull request, use **Create Pull Request** from the context
menu of the **Branches** view.

### Comments

GitHub allows to comment on a commit itself or individual line changes
(*diffs*). Comments can be applied to a commit or to a Pull Request.
Pull Request Comments will be refreshed together with those pull
requests which are locally available (see **Fetch Pull Request** above).
Plain Commit Comments will by default not be refreshed for performance
reasons. To tell SmartGit to fetch plain commit comments, too, configure
`github.commitCommentPageLimit` in the **Preferences, Low-Level
Properties**.

Both, Pull Request and Plain Commit Comments, can refer either to a
commit itself or to a specific line in a file:

-   Commit comments will show up in the **Commits** view.
-   Comments on individual lines will show up in the **Changes** view
    and the affected files will be highlighted in the **Files**
    and **Commits** view, too. This works the same way for line-comments
    of Pull Requests, provided that the pull request has been
    **Fetch**ed and the local pull request *merge* commit has been
    selected.

Comments can be created, modified and removed using the corresponding
actions from the **Comments** menu or context menu actions in
the **Commits** and **Changes** view. If a pull request *merge* commit
is selected, only line-comments of the pull request can be manipulated.

More behavior of the GitHub integration can be customized by [Low-Level
Properties](Preferences.md).

### Re-setup OAuth

Sometimes you may need to rerun the *OAuth* setup, e.g. if a more recent
version of SmartGit will request additional scopes. Usually, it's
sufficient to just open **Preferences**, section **Authentication**,
open the **GitHub** hosting provider and invoke **Generate API token**
there. If this does not solve your problem, take following steps to
rerun the *OAuth* setup from scratch:

1.  In SmartGit:
    1.  get rid of all GitHub-related credentials from **Preferences**,
        section **Authentication**
    2.  get rid of the GitHub hosting provider from **Preferences**,
        section **Hosting Providers**
2.  In GitHub, open your profile **Settings**, **Applications**,
    tab **Authorized OAuth Apps**:
    1.  Select "SmartGit" there:  
        ![](attachments/53215440/53215441.png)
    2.  Invoke **Revoke Access**
3.  In SmartGit, rerun through the *OAuth* setup again:
    1.  open **Preferences**, section **Authentication**
    2.  **Add** a new **GitHub** hosting provider, as described above

## Possible Problems & Solutions

### Authenticating with two or more accounts



SmartGit currently does not support having two **Hosting Providers**
configured for "github.com", hence for the extended integration
discussed above, you have to decide for one of your accounts. It's
however possible to access repositories of multiple GitHub accounts, as
explained below.



If you want to authenticate to your GitHub repositories, using two or
more accounts, open **Preferences**, section **Hosting Providers**, open
the GitHub hosting provider there and deselect **Use OAuth token for
repository authentication**. When pulling/pushing a GitHub repository
for the next time, SmartGit will ask you for **Username** and
**Password**. For the **Username**, just enter the appropriate GitHub
account name, for the **Password** it's recommended to generate a new
*Personal Access Token* in your GitHub account settings (the **repo**
scope needs to be selected).

Depending on your Git configuration, Git might request credentials only
*per-domain* instead of *per-repository*. If so, try to reconfigure:



``` java
git config --global credential.github.com.useHttpPath true
```



### Private repositories do not show up

If you are authenticating using *OAuth* and you can't see private
repositories of your GitHub *organization* or pushing to your
organization's repositories fails with HTTP error code *403*, make sure
that your organization allows **Third-party access** and SmartGit
is **Approved**. Your organization settings might look like this:

![](attachments/53215440/53215446.png)

Note that the screenshot above shows the interface of the organization's
manager. If you are not the manager, but just a member of the
organization, you can request access for SmartGit to this organization
from your **Settings - Applications**, tab **Authorized OAuth Apps**:
select **SmartGit** here and check for which organizations you may
request access. The screenshot below shows `syntdev2` for which access
can be requested. Once done so, the organization manager will receive a
notification and may confirm.

If your GitHub hosting provider is already set up in the Preferences and
you need to rerun through the *OAuth* setup, [as explained
above](#re-setup-oauth).



### Git-Flow Pull Requests will be closed on Finish Feature

When using [Git-Flow](Git-Flow.md) or [Git-Flow Light](Git-Flow-Light.md) in
combination with pull requests, pull requests may be marked
as **Closed** instead of **Merged** after invoking **Finish
Feature**. This happens when you have **Delete Feature Branch** selected
for the **Finish Feature** dialog: with this option selected, the local
and remote feature branch will be deleted immediately, however the
resulting merge/rebase has not yet been pushed. If a branch will be
deleted *before* it has been merged, GitHub will mark the pull request
as **Closed**. If it's only deleted *after* the branch has been merged,
it will be marked as **Merged**. If you don't want your pull requests to
become **Closed**, unselect **Delete Feature Branch**, push the
resulting merge/rebase first and only then **Delete** the feature branch
from GitHub (e.g. from the **Branches** view).

### Push fails with OAuth 'scope'-related warning

From time to time, GitHub may introduce new or change existing *OAuth
permission scopes.* In this case, SmartGit's OAuth token may stop
working. The solution is usually to rerun through the *OAuth* setup, [as
explained above](#re-setup-oauth).



Be sure to always try with the [latest SmartGit
release](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/download/) because we are
regularly adjusting required *scopes* for the latest version. If you
suspect that not even the latest version is requesting the scopes which
are required for your scenario, you may manually change the *scopes* in
the **Preferences**, **Low-Level Properties**, property
"github.oauth.scopes".



Typical Git error messages hinting to this kind of problem:



``` java
> ! refs/heads/some-branch:refs/heads/some-branch [remote rejected]
> (refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow
> `.github/workflows/some-workflow.yml` without `workflow` scope)
```
