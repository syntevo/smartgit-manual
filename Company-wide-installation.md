# Company-wide installation

For company-wide installations, the administrator may install SmartGit
on a read-only location or network share or customize the installation
process by e.g. using batch files. To set up a custom initial
configuration for the users, certain settings files can be prepared and
put into a directory named `default`. For MacOS this `default` directory
must be located in `SmartGit.app/Contents/Resources/` (parallel to the
`Java` directory), for other operating systems within SmartGit's
installation directory (parallel to the `lib` and `bin` directories).

When a user starts SmartGit for the first time, the following files will
be copied from the `default` directory (on the network share) to the
user's personal SmartGit settings directory (refer to [Default Location
of SmartGit's Settings
Directory](#Company-wideinstallation-settings-dir.default-location)):

-   `smartgit.properties`
-   `accelerators.yml`
-   `credentials.yml`
-   `hosting-providers.yml`
-   `preferences.yml`
-   `repository-grouping.yml`
-   `tools.yml`
-   `ui-config.yml`
-   `ui-state.yml`

The `license` file (only for 10+ user *Commercial* licenses) can also be
placed into the `default` directory. In the latter case, SmartGit will
prefill the **License** field in the **Set Up** wizard when a user
starts SmartGit for the first time. When upgrading SmartGit, this
`license` file will also be used, so users won't be prompted with a
'license expired' message, but can continue working seamlessly.


#### Note

>Be sure to name the license file `license` in the `default` directory

To preconfigure only a subset of default options to custom values and
leave initialization of other defaults to SmartGit, you may provide
reduced versions of the settings `.yml` files in the `default`
directory.


Example


If you want to preconfigure the used Git executable to
`C:\path\to\your\preferred\bin\git.exe`, you may use following
`settings.yml` file:



``` java
git:
  executable: C:\path\to\your\preferred\bin\git.exe
```





### System properties vs. VM options

From a technical perspective, [system properties](System-Properties.md)  
and [VM options](VM-options.md) are the same thing, they are just specified
in different files. System properties are specified in
`smartgit.properties` in the [SmartGit's Settings
Directory](#Company-wideinstallation-settings-dir.default-location), VM
options are specified in the `smartgit.vmoptions` file. From an
administrative perspective, it's recommended to configure all system
properties in the `smartgit.vmoptions` file and leave individual user
`smartgit.properties` files untouched.



`smartgit.vmoptions` is loaded before `smartgit.properties` and thus
properties present in `smartgit.vmoptions` have precedence over the same
properties specified in `smartgit.properties`. This way, when having a
read-only installation of SmartGit you can configure SmartGit in a
pretty safe way using `smartgit.vmoptions`.



### Overriding Defaults

By default, the files from the `default` directory will only be copied
during the initial setup of the user's SmartGit installation. In certain
scenarios, it may be desirable to replace a configuration even after
SmartGit has been set up for a user. For example, the **Tools** may be
managed by the administrator and updated from time to time. User should
receive these updates regardless whether their SmartGit is already set
up or not. In this case, you can use the [VM
option](VM-options.md)
`smartgit.startup.settingsToReplaceFromDefaults` to force overwriting
(i.e. to reset) the specified files in the user's settings directory.



#### Example
>
>
>
>To reset `tools.yml` on every start, add following line
>to `smartgit.vmoptions`:
>
>`         -Dsmartgit.startup.settingsToReplaceFromDefaults`=tools.yml
>
>

You can modify the `.yml` file in the `default` directory to only those
values that should be overridden or removed (the key needs to be
prefixed with a leading minus sign). For lists the default items will be
added first and user items are only kept if not equal to a default item.
List items that should be removed, need to have a key-value paid of
`__merge__: delete`.

### Hide Preferences

When you are providing initial defaults or specify to overwrite
defaults, you usually don't want the user to change these settings in
the **Preferences**. Therefore, you might want to hide certain
**Preferences** pages, using [system
properties](System-Properties.md#smartgitpreferencescategoryvisible)
.
