# GitLab

SmartGit integrates GitLab workflows in various places, very similar to
the [GitHub](GitHub-integration.md#GitHubintegration-github)
integration. Some behavior can be customized by [system
properties](System-Properties.md#SystemProperties-properties.bitbucket)
.

### Setup

To set up the GitLab integration, go to **Preferences**, section
**Hosting Providers** and use **Add** there. In the **Add Hosting
Provider** dialog, have **GitLab** selected and invoke **Generate API
token**. This should open up your default web browser where you will
have to confirm by **Authorize.**

Once you have confirmed this page, you will be redirected to
*[syntevo.com](http://syntevo.com)*, where the generated access code
will be displayed. Copy&paste this code into SmartGit's **Generate API
Token** dialog and invoke **Authenticate**. The code will be used to
create an *application access token* which will be used to populate the
**Token** field. Finally, confirm the **Add Hosting Provider** dialog
using **Add**.



Once you have authorized SmartGit, it will show up in your GitLab
**Settings**, section **Applications**. If you need to rerun through the
Authorization process outlined above, you have to **Revoke** access
there first and start over.
