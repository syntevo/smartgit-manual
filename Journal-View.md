# Journal View

The Journal shows a compact history (Log) for the current branch:

-   *orange* commits denote *ahead* commits which are just present on
    your *local* branch but not yet on the *remote* branch. These
    commits will be sent to the remote branch/repository for the next
    [Push](Synchronizing-with-Remote-Repositories.md).
-   *green* commits denote *incoming* commits which are only present in
    the *remote* branch and will be integrated into your *local* branch
    for the next [Pull](Synchronizing-with-Remote-Repositories.md).
-   *black* commits with *green* connectors denote commits which are
    currently present in the *remote* branch only, but have been present
    in your *local* branch at an earlier time. Usually, these are
    commits which have been *rewritten* using [Rebase](Rebase.md). To show
    such commits, invoke **Show Rewritten Commits** from the options
    menu.
-   *black* commits with *blue* connectors denote commits from the
    *auxiliary* branch which can be toggled using **Show Auxiliary
    Branch** from the options menu.
-   *black* commits with *gray* connectors denote commits which are
    common to more than one of the *local*, *remote* or *auxiliary*
    branch.

Depending on the type of commit(s) selected, you can invoke various
operations from the context menu, most notably, you can easily rewrite
the history:

-   To squash adjacent commits, select them and invoke **Squash
    Commits** and provide the new commit message.
-   To reorder commits, just use drag and drop.
-   To coalesce two (not necessarily adjacent) commits *with the same
    commit message*, drag one of the commits onto the other one.
-   To change the commit message, select the commit and invoke **Edit
    Commit Message**.
-   To change the author, select the commit and invoke **Edit Author**.

The number of commits displayed per category is limited, so the graph
will stay neatly arranged even if there are lots of commits per category
(e.g. hundreds or thousands of incoming commits). If you want to see
more commits for a certain category you can expand this category by
clicking the dashed area after its last commit. To expand all categories
at once, you can use **Show More Commits (Temporarily)** from the action
menu. You can permanently change the default number of displayed commits
using System Properties.

## Modify or Split Commit

### Modify

To amend something to a selected (unpushed) commit, use the **Modify**
option. This will start an interactive rebase and stop after the
selected commit. Perform the modification and then click
**Commit/Continue** toolbar button, select **Create Commit** and in the
Commit dialog select the **Amend last commit** checkbox. Now click again
**Commit/Continue** toolbar button and select **Continue Rebase**. To
abort the Modify command and go back to the previous state, use the
**Abort** toolbar button.

### Split

To split 1 selected (unpushed) commit into 2 commits (with the same
message), use the **Split** option. This will start an interactive
rebase and stop with the commit's changes in the Index. Discard all
changes that you don't want to have in the first commit, click
**Commit/Continue** and select **Continue Rebase**. Normally this should
be sufficient, but it might be necessary to fix potential conflicts in
the next commit.



For the split command, the interactive rebase stops after the selected
commit, a `git reset --soft ^HEAD` is performed to put the commit's
changes into the Index. After selecting **Continue Rebase**, the commit
is applied a second time to add all the remaining parts that were not
committed in the first commit, followed by the further commits.



## Interactive Rebase

As stated above, you may perform a couple of modification operations
already using specific commands, e.g. reordering commits by drag and
drop. They will be performed immediately. If you have to make multiple
changes at once or the immediate commands aborted because of conflicts,
you should rather use the Interactive Rebase.

To start the interactive rebase command, select the first commit that
should be changed. In the occurring *Interactive Rebase* dialog you will
be able to perform similar operations like in the Journal directly, e.g.
squash commits, reorder using drag and drop, edit commit messages, but
they only are performed when clicking the **Rebase** button. In case of
conflicts, the rebase will stop (like a normal rebase, too). After
solving the conflicts, click the **Commit/Continue** toolbar button and
select **Continue Rebase**. To abort the interactive rebase and go back
to the previous state, use the **Abort** toolbar button.

Commits with the same commit message (a prefix "fixup! " is allowed) are
highlighted, so it is easier to see commits belonging together. They can
be amend-squashed by using drag and drop. Alternatively, the Auto-Squash
button offers 2 options how to squash such commits:

-   Neighboring Commits: will squash only those equally named,
    neighboring (adjacent) commits.
-   To 1st Commit: will amend-squash later, equally named, neighboring
    commits to the 1st equally named commit.
