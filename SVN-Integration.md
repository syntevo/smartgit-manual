# SVN Integration

## Overview

Git allows you to interact not only with other Git repositories, but
also with SVN repositories. This means that you can use SmartGit like an
SVN client:

-   Cloning from an SVN repository is similar to checking out an SVN
    working copy.
-   Pulling from an SVN repository is similar to updating an SVN working
    copy.
-   Pushing to an SVN repository is similar to committing from an SVN
    working copy to the SVN server.

In addition to the SVN functionality, you can use all (local) Git
features like local commits and branching. SmartGit performs all SVN
operations transparently, so you will notice only a few points in the
program where you need to understand which server VCS you are using.

## Compatibility and Incompatibility Modes

SmartGit's SVN integration is available in two modes:

-   **Normal Mode** This is the recommended mode of operation. It is
    used by default when a repository is freshly cloned with SmartGit
    (not with *git-svn*). All features are supported in this mode. The
    created repositories are not compatible with *git-svn*.
-   **git-svn Compatibility Mode** In the git-svn compatibility mode (or
    just 'compatibility mode ') SmartGit can work with repositories that
    were created using the *git-svn* command. In this mode advanced
    features like *EOLs-*, *ignores-* and *externals-translation* are
    turned off. The SVN history is processed in a similar way as by
    *git-svn*.

## Ignores (Normal Mode Only)

SmartGit maps `svn:ignore` properties to `.gitignore` files. Unlike the
`git svn create-ignore` command SmartGit puts `.gitignore` files under
version control. If you modify a `.gitignore` file and pushes the
change, the corresponding `svn:ignore` property is changed.

The `.gitignore` syntax is significantly more powerful than the
`svn:ignore` syntax. Hence, `svn:ignore` can be mapped losslessly to
`.gitignore`, however a `.gitignore` file may contain a pattern that
can't be mapped backed to `svn:ignore`. In that case the pattern is not
translated.

Adding or removing a recursive pattern in `.gitignore` corresponds to
setting or unsetting that pattern on every existing directory in the SVN
repository. Conversely, when an SVN revision is fetched (back) into the
Git repository, a recursive pattern will be translated to a set of
non-recursive patterns, one pattern for each directory.



#### Example
>
>
>
>Let's assume we have the following directories in the SVN repository:
>
>
>
>``` text
>A {
>  B {}
>  C {}
>}
>```
>
>
>
>And we add `.gitignore` with only one line:
>
>
>
>``` text
>somefile
>```
>
>
>
>and push. This will set the `svn:ignore`-property to `somefile` for all
>directories: *A*, *B*, *C*. After fetching such a revision we have the
>following `.gitignore` contents (ordering of lines is unimportant):
>
>
>
>``` text
>A/somefile
>A/B/somefile
>A/C/somefile
>```
>
>
>
>

Git doesn't support patterns that contain spaces. Hence, SmartGit
replaces all spaces in the `svn:ignore` value with `[!!-~]` during the
creation of `.gitignore`. Conversely, all newly added patterns
containing `[!!-~]` are converted to `svn:ignore` with spaces at the
corresponding places.

## EOLs (Normal Mode Only)

When using *git-svn* on Windows, different EOLs on different systems may
cause trouble. For instance, if the SVN repository contains a file with
`svn:eol-style` set to `CRLF`, its content is stored with CRLF line
endings. Moreover, *git-svn* puts the file contents directly into Git
blobs without modification. Now, if you have the `core.autocrlf` Git
option set to `true`, it may be impossible to get a *clean* working
tree, and hence `git svn dcommit` won't work. This happens because while
checking whether the working tree is *clean*, Git converts working tree
file EOLs to *LF* and compares with the blob contents (which has
*CRLF*). On the other hand, setting `core.autocrlf` to `false` causes
problems with files that contain *LF* EOLs.

Instead of setting a global option, SmartGit carefully sets the EOL for
every file in the SVN repository using its `svn:eol-style` and
`svn:mime-type` values. It uses the versioned `.gitattributes` file for
this purpose. Its settings have higher priority than the
*core.autocrlf*-option, so with SmartGit it doesn't matter what the
*core.autocrlf* value is.


#### Warning
>
>
>The `.git/info/attributes` file has higher priority than the versioned
>`.gitattributes` files, so it is strongly recommended to delete the
>former or leave it empty. Otherwise, this may confuse Git or SmartGit.
>
>

By default, a newly added text file (or more precisely, a file that Git
thinks is a text file) which is pushed has `svn:eol-style` set to
`native` and no `svn:mime-type` property set. A newly added binary file
has no properties at all.

One can control individual file properties using the `svneol` Git
attribute. The syntax is
`svneol=<svn:eol-style value>#<svn:mime-type value>`, so for example



``` text
*.c svneol=LF#unset
```



means all `*.c` files will have `svn:eol-style=LF` and no
`svn:mime-type` set after pushing. Recursive attributes are translated
like recursive ignores: Their changes result in changes of properties of
all files in the SVN repository.

## Externals (Normal Mode Only)

SmartGit maps `svn:externals` properties to its own kind of submodules,
that have the same interface as Git submodules.


#### Note
>
>
>Only externals pointing to directories are supported, not externals
>pointing to individual files ('file externals').
>
>

SVN submodules are defined in the file `.gitsvnextmodules`, which has
the following format:



``` text
[submodule "path/to/submodule"]
  path = path/to/submodule
  owner = /
  url = https://server/path
  revision = 1234
  branch = trunk
  fetch = trunk:refs/remotes/svn/trunk
  branches = branches/*:refs/remotes/svn/*
  tags = tags/*:refs/remote-tags/svn/*
  remote = svn
  type = dir
```



-   **path** specifies the submodule location relative to the working
    tree root.
-   **owner** specifies the SVN directory that has a corresponding
    svn:externals property. The owner directory should be a parent of
    the submodule location. If the owner is the root of the parent
    repository itself, the option should be set to "/".
-   **url** specifies the SVN URL to be cloned there (svn:externals
    syntax can be used here) without a certain branch.
-   **revision** specifies the revision to be cloned. Absence of this
    option or using *HEAD* means the latest available revision.
-   **fetch, branches, tags** they all specify the SVN repository layout
    and have the same meaning as the corresponding *git-svn* options of
    `.git/config`.
-   **branch** specifies the branch to checkout. It should be a path
    relative to the URL of the *url* option, and it must be consistent
    with the SVN repository layout. The *empty* branch (if
    `fetch=:refs/remotes/git-svn`) should be specified using slash `/`.
-   **remote** specifies the name of the *svn-git-remote* section of the
    submodule.
-   **type** specifies the type of the submodule (default: `dir`). In
    practice, this is usually a directory. If svn:externals points to a
    file, this option should have the value `file`.

Changes in `.gitsvnextmodules` are translated to the SVN repository as
changes in `svn:externals` and vice versa.

There are two types of SVN submodules between which you can choose
during *submodule initialization*:

-   **snapshot submodules** contain exactly one revision of the SVN
    repository. They are useful in those cases where the external points
    to a third party library that is not changed as part of the project
    (parent repository).
-   **normal submodules** are completely cloned repositories of the
    corresponding externals. It's recommended to use them when working
    in both the parent repository and the submodule repository.

SmartGit shows the repository status in the *Directories* view. If the
submodule's current state does not exactly correspond to the state
defined by `.gitsvnextmodules` (same URL, revisions, ...), it will show
ups as *modified*. In this case, can use **Local\|Stage** to update the
`.gitsvnextmodules` configuration to the current SVN submodule state or
you can use **Remote\|Submodule\|Reset** to put the submodule back into
the state as it is registered in `.gitsvnextmodules`.

## Symlinks and Executable Files

*Symlink* processing and *executable*-bit processing work in the same
way as in *git-svn*. SVN uses the `svn:special` property to mark a file
as being a *symlink*. Then its content should look like this:



``` text
link path/to/target
```



Such files are converted to *Git symlinks*. In a similar way, files with
`svn:executable` are converted to *Git executable* files and vice versa.

## Other SVN properties (Normal Mode Only)

SmartGit maps all other properties which do not have a special meaning
in the Git world to *Git attributes*.

Depending on the size of the property value, SmartGit may store the
entire property definition (name and value) just as an attribute in
`.gitattributes` or it may decide to store the property value in a
separate file. In the latter case, `.gitattributes` will contain an
attribute `attr` which is just *set*, i.e. has no value, denoting the
presence of the property for the corresponding file. The value will be
stored in `.gitsvnattributes/path/to/entry/attr` instead, where
`path/to/entry` is the same path as in `.gitattributes`, i.e. the
working tree path of the file or directory to which the property
belongs. The mapping between SVN property name and Git attribute name
depends on the property name:

-   A property which belong to the *svn:*-namespace and does not yet
    have a special mapping (as explained in the previous sections) will
    be mapped to a Git attribute starting with the `svn_`-prefix. This
    means, that property `svn:keywords` will be mapped to attribute
    `svn_keywords` and `svn:needs-lock` will be mapped to
    `svn_needs-lock`.
-   For all other properties (custom properties), an SVN property with
    name `foo` will be mapped to a Git attribute with name `svnc_foo`.

### Adding a property

If the property value is a small, one-line text property, you may add it
directly to `.gitattributes`.



#### Example
>
>
>
>To add custom property *foo* with value *bar* to file `file.txt`, insert
>following line into `.gitattributes` (or add the attribute to an already
>existing line for `/file.txt`):
>
>
>
>``` text
>/file.txt svnc_foo=bar
>```
>
>
>
>

If the property value is large, consists of multiple lines or is even of
binary content, you have to add the *control* entry to `.gitattributes`
and create the file `.gitsvnattributes/path/to/entry/attr` containing
the property's value.



#### Example
>
>
>
>To add a binary property *foo* with some binary value to file
>`file.txt`, insert following line into `.gitattributes` (or add the
>attribute to an already existing line for `/file.txt`):
>
>
>
>``` text
>/file.txt svnc_foo
>```
>
>
>
>and add file `.gitattributes/file.txt/svnc_foo` with the desired binary
>property content.
>
>

### Modifying a property

Depending on the size of the property value, the value will either be
stored directly in `.gitattributes`, or in `.gitsvnattributes`, as
explained before. To modify the value, locate either of the two places
where it is stored and modify the value there. After having committed
this change and pushed to SVN, the modified property value will show up
in the SVN repository.



#### Example
>
>
>
>To change a small, one-line property value *foo* for `file.txt` which is
>stored in `.gitattributes` to a larger, multi-line or binary property
>value, replace the Git attribute value by the Git attribute name itself
>(i.e. mark it as *set*):
>
>
>
>``` text
>/file.txt svnc_foo             
>```
>
>
>
>and add file `.gitattributes/file.txt/svnc_foo` with the desired
>property content.
>
>

### Removing a property

Depending on the size of the property value, the value will either be
stored directly in `.gitattributes`, or in `.gitsvnattributes`, as
explained before. To remove the property, remove the corresponding
attribute from `.gitattributes` and remove the corresponding file from
`.gitsvnattributes`, if it's present there. After having committed this
change and pushed to SVN, the property deletion will show up in the SVN
repository.

## Tags

Unlike *git-svn*, SmartGit creates Git tags for SVN tags. If an SVN tag
was created by a simple directory copying, SmartGit creates a tag that
points to the copy-source; otherwise SmartGit creates a tag that points
to the corresponding commit of `refs/remote-tags/svn/<tagname>`. Git
tags can be sent back to the SVN repository (as SVN tags) by
right-clicking the tag in the **Branches** view and invoking **Push**.


#### Note
>
>
>Git tags that are actually *objects* on their own (not just simple
>*refs*) are not supported.
>
>

## History Processing

### Branch Replacements

In *compatibility mode*, SmartGit processes the SVN history like
*git-svn* does, with the difference that SmartGit doesn't support the
`svk:merge` property. In the case where one SVN branch was replaced,
SmartGit and *git-svn* create a *merge-commit*.

In *normal mode*, SmartGit uses its own way of history processing: In
case of branch replacements no *merge commit* is created; instead a Git
reference
`refs/svn-attic/svn/<branch name>/<the latest revision where the branch existed>`
is created.


#### Tip

>
>Though that functionality should be used with care, it is easy to create
>a branch replacement commit from SmartGit:
>
>-   Use **Local\|Reset** to reset to some other commit
>-   Invoke **Remote\|Push**. SmartGit will ask whether the current
>    branch should be replaced.
>
>

### Merges

#### Translating Merges from SVN to Git

Completely merged SVN branches correspond to merged Git branches. In
particular, for SVN revisions that change `svn:mergeinfo` in such a way
that some branch becomes completely merged, SmartGit creates a Git
*merge-commit*. For branches which have not been completely merged, no
*merge-commit* is created.

#### Translating Merges from Git to SVN

Pushing Git *merge-commits* results in a corresponding `svn:mergeinfo`
modification, denoting that the branch has been completely merged.

### Cherry-picks

SmartGit supports translation of two kinds of cherry-pick merges between
SVN and Git:

-   either done using SmartGit,
-   or done using another Git client, without the `--no-commit` option,
    to make sure that the commit message meta info (`git-svn: ...`) is
    preserved.

Only cherry-picks of Git commits that correspond to (already pushed) SVN
revisions (but not local commits) are supported. Pushing of a
cherry-pick commit results in a corresponding `svn:mergeinfo` change.

### Branch Creation

SmartGit allows to create SVN branches simply by pushing locally created
Git branches. In this case, SmartGit will ask you to configure the
branch for pushing.


#### Note
>
>
>SmartGit always creates a separate SVN revision when creating a branch,
>which contains purely the branch creation. This helps to avoid troubles
>when merging from that branch later.
>
>

### Anonymous Branches

Anonymous branches show up very often in Git repositories where the
default Pull behavior is *merge* instead of *rebase*. Such branches are
not mapped back to SVN, as *anonymous SVN branches* are not supported.
For instance, the following history:



``` text
  E-F
 /   \
A-B-C-D-G-H (branch)
```



will be pushed as a linear list of commits: *A,B,C,D,G,H*. *E* and *F*
won't be pushed at all.

## The Push Process

Pushing a commit consists of 3 phases:

-   sending the commit to SVN
-   fetching it back
-   replacing the existing local commit with the commit being fetched
    back

Note that not only the local commit is replaced but also all commits and
tags that depend on it. For example, if there is a local commit with a
Git tag attached to it, after pushing the Git tag will be moved to the
commit that has been fetched back from the SVN repository.

The pushing process requires the working tree to be clean to start, and
it uses the working tree very actively during the whole process. Hence,
it is *STRONGLY RECOMMENDED* not to make any changes in the working tree
during the pushing process, otherwise these changes may become
discarded.

Sometimes it is impossible to replace the existing local commit with the
commit being fetched back, because other commits (from other users)
might have been fetched back as well, containing changes that conflict
with the remaining local commits. In this case, SmartGit leaves the
working tree clean and asks you whether to resolve the problem. The
easiest way to do so is to press Pull with the **Rebase** option turned
on, which will start the rebase process.



#### Example
>
>
>
>The last repository revision is *r10*. There are 2 local commits *A* and
>*B* that will be pushed. First, *A* is sent, resulting in revision
>*r12*, because in the meantime someone else had committed *r11*. Now,
>*r11* and *r12* (corresponding to local commit *A*) are fetched back.
>Let's assume that *r11* and local commit *B* contain changes for the
>same file in the same line. Hence, replacing *A* by the fetched-back
>commits *r11* and *r12* won't work, because the changes of *B* are
>conflicting now and can't be applied on top of *r12*.
>
>

## SVN Support Configuration

### SVN URL and SVN Layout Specification

In *compatibility mode*, `.git/config` is used for the specification of
the SVN URL and the SVN repository layout. In *normal mode*, SmartGit
uses the file `.git/svn/.svngit/svngitkit.config` for this purpose.

In *compatibility mode*, the SVN URL and SVN layout are specified in the
`svn-remote` section. In *normal mode*, the corresponding section is
called `svn-git-remote`.

The section generally looks like this:



``` text
[svn-git-remote "svn"]
        url = https://server/path
        rewriteRoot = https://anotherserver/path
        fetch = trunk:refs/remotes/svn/trunk
        branches = branches/*:refs/remotes/svn/*
        additional-branches = path/*:refs/remotes/*;another/path:refs/remotes/another/branch
        tags = tags/*:refs/remote-tags/svn/*
```



-   **url** specifies the physical SVN URL with which to connect to the
    SVN repository.
-   **rewriteRoot** specifies the URL to be used in the Git commit
    messages of fetched commits. If this option is omitted, it is
    assumed to be the same as the value of the *url* option. The
    *rewriteRoot* option is useful for continuing working with the
    repository after the original SVN URL has been changed (in this case
    *rewriteRoot* should be changed to the old SVN URL value).
-   **fetch, branches, additional-branches, tags** specify pairs
    consisting of an SVN path and a Git reference for various
    interesting paths in the SVN repository. All paths beyond these
    won't be considered by SmartGit. There's practically no difference
    between these options. Options *fetch*, *branches*, *tags* are
    supported by `git-svn` and allow only 1 pair. Option
    *additional-branches* is only supported by SmartGit and allows an
    arbitrary number of `;`-separated pairs. Option *fetch* for
    *compatibility mode* defines the branch to be checked out and
    configured as tracked after fetch. SmartGit doesn't support
    `git-svn` patterns in the config and only allows the usage of
    asterisks (`*`). The number of asterisks in the SVN path and Git
    reference pattern must be equal. No patterns except the *fetch*
    pattern must intersect.

### Translation Options

SmartGit keeps all translation options in the `core` section of the file
`.git/svn/.svngit/svngitkit.config`.

The section looks like this:



``` text
[core]
            processExternals = true
            processIgnores = true
            processEols = true
            processTags = true
            processOtherProperties = true
            gitSvnAttributesThreshold = 32
            
```



These boolean options specify whether SmartGit should enable special
handling of `svn:externals`, `svn:eol-style/svn:mime-type`,
`svn:ignore`, SVN tags and all other SVN properties, as explained above.
The `gitSvnAttributesThreshold` specifies the maximum length of a Git
attribute value, which may be stored in `.gitattributes`. If the length
of the attribute value is larger, it will be stored in the
`.gitsvnattributes` directory structure, as explained in [Other SVN
properties (Normal Mode Only)](#other-svn-properties-normal-mode-only).


#### Warning
>
>
>These options are set once before the first fetch and must not be
>changed afterwards.
>
>

In *nomal mode*, all these options are set to `true` by default except
when SmartGit detects that the `.gitattributes` file has become too
large (in that case *processEols* and *processOtherProperties* is set to
`false`). In *compatibility mode*, all these options are set to `false`.

### Tracking Configuration

SmartGit's SVN support has a tracking configuration similar to Git's. If
some local branch (say, `refs/heads/branch`) tracks some remote branch
(`refs/remotes/svn/branch`), then:

-   it is possible to push the local branch, and doing so will result in
    the corresponding SVN branch modification according to the
    repository layout. If the local branch is not configured as tracking
    branch of some remote branch, it won't be pushed;
-   while fetching, SmartGit proposes to rebase the local tracking
    branch onto the tracked branch after a Pull if the corresponding
    option is selected.


#### Warning
>
>
>If some branch contains a merge-commit that has a merge-parent that
>doesn't belong to any tracking branch, `svn:mergeinfo` won't be modified
>when pushing such a branch.
>
>

SmartGit uses the `branch` sections of the
`.git/svn/.svngit/svngitkit.config` file for tracking configuration.

The section looks like this:



``` text
[branch "master"]
            tracks = refs/remotes/svn/trunk
            remote = svn
            
```



The name of the section is the local branch name.

-   **tracks** specifies the remote tracked branch
-   **remote** specifies the remote section name with the SVN URL and
    SVN repository layout

### Tweaking the configuration

When cloning a repository with **Just initialize clone (expert mode)**
option, SmartGit will only create a repository stub which will be
reported as *incomplete*. This allows you to tweak the *Translation
options* and the *Tracking Configuration* by changing
the `.git/svn/.svngit/svngitkit.config` file accordingly. After you have
done so, you will have to restart the clone by pulling your repository.



After the clone has been initialized, only `[svn-git-remote]` can be
tweaked. `[core]` options can't be changed anymore at this stage,
instead they have to be customized using system properties before
starting SmartGit. Changing the `[core]` configuration by system
properties, will not only affect SmartGit's processing but also the Git
repository configuration:

-   If you set `processEols=false`, then `core.autocrlf` is set
    to `true`: the idea behind this logic is that if EOLs are controlled
    by `.gitattributes` settings (`processEols=true`),
    then `core.autocrlf` should be `false` in order not to interfere
    with `.gitattributes`. If `processEols=false` then there will be no
    `.gitattributes` which (usually) performs CRLF-to-LF
    canonicalization in the repository (what usually is desirable).
    `core.autocrlf=true` has proven to be the lesser evil in this case.





Configuring SmartGit to manage non-standard SVN layouts properly, often
requires a lot of support from us. Hence we only offer support for SVN
for customers with a 10+ users perpetual SmartGit license and a valid
support period.





There are known problems with non-standard SVN layouts in externals
(submodules).



### NTLM authentication

If your server supports NTLM authentication and SmartGit fails to
connect to your server with authentication-related errors
like `401 Authorization Required`, you should try to force SmartGit to
use *Basic* authentication first by setting following [system
property](System-Properties.md):



``` java
svnkit.http.methods=Basic,NTLM
```



### SVN authors mapping

SmartGit does not support Git config `svn.authorsfile`, but provides a
similar mechanism via system property `smartgit.svn.authorsfile`: the
specified file is respected when translating SVN revisions to Git
commits. For the opposite direction it's the SVN server which chooses
the revision author (usually the same as the credentials username). The
file format is the same as git-svn's authors file (for `--authors-file`
option). File encoding is UTF-8 (since version 17.1).


####Example
> 
> On Windows, if your authors-file is located at `c:\temp\svn.authors`,
> set the system property to:
> 
>     smartgit.svn.authorsfile=c:/temp/svn.authors



## System properties affecting the SVN integration

Following [system properties](System-Properties.md) can used to customize
the SVN integration:

### smartgit.clone.svnAllowed 

Set to `false` to disable the possibility to clone SVN repositories.

### smartgit.defaultConnectionLogging 

Set to `true` to have SVN connection logging enabled. This will create a
connection.log in SmartGit's settings directory which will be helpful
for error diagnosis.

### smartgit.svn.gitAttributesSizeThreshold 

For certain SVN repositories, the .gitattributes file may become very
large, which would slow down various (Smart)Git operations. For that
reason, the mapping of svn:eol-style and svn:mime-type will be disabled
if the size of the .gitattributes file exceeds the threshold specified
by the specified value (in bytes). For more information, see
<http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/documentation.html?page=concepts-svn>
To have the .gitattributes mapping always enabled, you may set the
threshold to a large value.

### smartgit.submoduleRecurseInUnchangedSvn 

Set to `true` to enable recursion into unchanged SVN submodules when a
submodule update is performed. This may be useful if you always want to
fetch the latest revisions from an SVN repository even if the
svn:external which is mapped to .gitsvnextmodules does require fetching
these revisions.

### smartgit.svn.glueFeature 

Set to `false` to prevent glueing of multiple revisions together when
performing an SVN clone. Glueing revisions together improves performance
and usually has no negative side-effects. Sometimes, for large
repositories, it may result in out-of-memory errors, though.

### smartgit.svn.scanSubmodulesForNonSvnParents

Set to `true` to scan (refresh) SVN sub-modules for non-SVN parent
repositories.



This option not officially supported and will be removed for SmartGit
19.2. We recommend to either do a one-time conversion of your SVN
repositories or switch to [SubGit](https://subgit.com/) for maintaining
a steady bridge to SVN.



### smartgit.svn.defaultCommitMessage

Use this option to change the default SVN "commit message" when e.g.
pushing a tag. There are a couple of variables, which will be replaced
by proper strings:` {Action}, {Actiond}`, `{action}`, `{actiond}`,
`{target}`, `{source}`, `{sourceRevision}`.

#### Example
>
>
>
>Some example definitions:
>
>
>
>``` java
>{Actiond} {target}{ from {source}{:{sourceRevision}}}
>{target} {action} { from {source}{:{sourceRevision}}}
>```
>
>
>
>

## Known Limitations

There are following notable limitations of SmartGit's SVN integration,

### Renames wont be 'mapped' from SVN to Git

Renames from SVN can't be mapped to Git: Git will always detect renames
on the fly, based on content comparison:

-   If the original file and the renamed file from SVN are too
    different, Git won't detect this rename.
-   If there is a removed file and an added file in SVN (for which no
    rename in SVN is tracked) and contents of both files are similar,
    Git may detect this as rename.

### File externals not supported

File externals are currently not supported. There are following possible
workarounds:

-   create an unversioned symlink locally without adding it to the
    repository
-   replace the file with a symlink in the repository (won't work on
    Windows)
-   use directory externals (they are supported by SmartGit)

### Further Limitations

-   Empty directories can't be managed by Git and won't be available
-   File locks are not supported
-   Sparse check-outs are not supported
-   The svk:merge property is not supported

## Known Issues

There are following the most common issues when using SmartGit's SVN
integration

### Network errors

Depending on the SVN protocol used the following messages usually
correspond to network errors:

-   "Connection reset"
-   "Malformed network data"
-   "chunked stream ended unexpectedly"
-   "Compression of svndiff data failed"
-   "Premature end of file"
-   "CRLF expected at end of chunk: -1/-1"
-   "XML document structures must start and end within the same entity"

By default upon a network error SmartGit retries the operation 3 times
silently but if it fails 3 times in a row, the overall operation fails
with one of the messages above. Sometimes it's sufficient to just retry
the latest operation to proceed or check the network connectivity.

However sometimes this could be also caused by SVN server issues (e.g.
lack of resources like memory, hard drive, bugs in the SVN server
software). So if retry doesn't help and the network problems are solved
but the error still occurs, it makes sense (if possible) to contact the
SVN server administrator and/or lookup the SVN server logs. For
instance, if the SVN server software is Apache + mod_dav_svn module, it
is useful to have a look at Apache logs. Records like



**Apache log example**

> 
> \[Fri Feb 28 14:45:04.503375 2020\] \[core:notice\] \[pid 25516:tid
> 139792668309376\] AH00051: child pid 12928 exit signal Segmentation
> fault (11), possible coredump in /etc/apache2
> 
> \[Fri Feb 28 14:46:35.584776 2020\] \[core:notice\] \[pid 25516:tid
> 139792668309376\] AH00051: child pid 12927 exit signal Segmentation
> fault (11), possible coredump in /etc/apache2

could mean that some Apache worker died because of a bug and in this
case updating mod_dav_svn on the SVN server to the latest version could
help.

Another possible reason for a reproducible network error are SVN server
limitations on response **size** and response **timeout**. There's a
number of ways to configure Apache server and there's a number of Apache
modules but here's a couple of examples of such connection limiting
directives:

-   [ProxyPass](httpd://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html) and
    ProxyPassReverse when mod_proxy is used
-   [Timeout](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#timeout)
    directive of core module

Usually the default values of such directives are reasonable enough for
the most of real life cases but when changed to be more restrictive,
they can cause unexpected connection cut in the middle of request or
response.
