# Managing Remotes

You can **Add**, **Rename** and **Delete** remotes from the **Remote**
menu or directly from the **Branches** view.



SVN remotes can't be delete, because they can't be re-added easily. If
you still want to get rid of an SVN remote, e.g. because this was a
one-time conversion from an SVN repository to Git, you can manually
delete the subtree `.git/svn`.
