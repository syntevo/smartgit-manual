# Cherry-Pick

The Cherry-Pick command allows you to 'apply' certain commits from
another branch to the current branch.

In SmartGit, there are several places from which you can initiate a
cherry-pick:

-   On the working tree window, select **Branch\|Cherry-Pick** to open
    the **Cherry-Pick** dialog, where you can select one or more commits
    to cherry-pick. Depending on your toolbar settings, you can also
    open this dialog via the **Cherry-Pick** button on the toolbar.
-   In the Log **Graph**, you can perform a cherry-pick by
    right-clicking on one or more commits and selecting **Cherry-Pick**
    from the context-menu.
-   From the Log's **Files** view context-menu, you can cherry-pick a
    subset of files.
